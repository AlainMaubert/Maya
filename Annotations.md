Set up scene in Maya.
1. Reference images set for side and front view to guide stylized character modelling.

  * Scene setup in Maya 2026.2 showing front and side reference images aligned for accurate 3D modelling proportions.‚Äù

2. Four-view layout in Maya 2026.2 showing the complete block-out of a stylized character. The Top and Side views display shaded geometry, while the Perspective and Front views show the wireframe overlay. This demonstrates accurate alignment with reference images, consistent proportions, and organized early-stage topology suitable for rigging and animation.

3. Full body joint hierarchy created in Autodesk Maya 2026.2.
Shown in four-view layout (Top, Front, Side, Perspective) with X-Ray Joints enabled to illustrate accurate anatomical alignment and symmetrical rig construction.

4. Stylized character block-out with skeleton and smooth skin binding applied. Four-view layout demonstrates proportion, joint placement, and initial deformation setup.

5. The character animation:
