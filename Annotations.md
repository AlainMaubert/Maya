Set up scene in Maya.
1. Reference images set for side and front view to guide stylized character modelling.

2. Four-view layout in Maya 2026.2 showing the complete block-out of a stylized character. The Top and Side views display shaded geometry, while the Perspective and Front views show the wireframe overlay. This demonstrates accurate alignment with reference images, consistent proportions, and organized early-stage topology suitable for rigging and animation.

3. Full body joint hierarchy created in Autodesk Maya 2026.2.
Shown in four-view layout (Top, Front, Side, Perspective) with X-Ray Joints enabled to illustrate accurate anatomical alignment and symmetrical rig construction.

4. Stylized character block-out with skeleton and smooth skin binding applied. Four-view layout demonstrates proportion, joint placement, and initial deformation setup.

5. The character animation:

6. This project demonstrates a complete 3D animation pipeline using Autodesk Maya 2026.2 and Unity 6000.2.1f1.

The character was modeled from simple primitives, rigged with a joint hierarchy, and animated using inverse kinematics (IK) to produce a natural arm-raise gesture. The animation was exported as an FBX and integrated into Unity, where it was looped and previewed in real time.

This workflow showcases the practical bridge between 3D Animation and Video Game Design, illustrating how rigged assets can transition from digital modeling environments to interactive engines — a foundational process also applicable to Virtual Reality development.

3D character rig and animation created in Autodesk Maya 2026.2 and implemented in Unity 6000.2.1f1. Demonstrates smooth skin binding, IK-based motion, and seamless transfer from animation workflow to game engine for real-time applications.




Shows Full Pipeline

You modeled a character from primitives → rigged it → applied IK → bound skin → animated it.

This demonstrates the core skills expected in CTCH/DES 314 (3D Animation, character rigging, motion).

Professional Techniques

Use of inverse kinematics (arms and legs)

Smooth skin binding and weight adjustments (head, arms)

Animation Demonstrates Motion

You’ve created a simple, looping animation, showing your understanding of timing, interpolation, and pose staging.

Playblast or video in Unity demonstrates real-time engine integration, which is a bonus for Video Game Design and VR.
